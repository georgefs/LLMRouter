He added 17 fish from the store, making a new total of orange and white fish.\n3. The number of orange fish is now twice the number of white fish.\n\nLet's use algebra to solve this. Let x be the number of white fish Bob bought from the store. Then, the number of orange fish in the pond after adding the new ones is 2x. The total number of white fish (initial 4 plus new ones) is 4 + x. The total number of orange fish (initial 3 plus new ones) is 3 + 2x.\n\nSince the total number of fish in the pond is the same for both white and orange fish, we can write the equation:\n\n4 + x + 3 + 2x = 17 + 3 + 4\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n5x = 9\n\nx = 9 / 5 = 1.8\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a fish, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that the condition of having twice as many orange fish as white fish is met. Therefore, Bob bought 2 white fish at the store.\n\nThe final answer is that Bob bought 2 white fish at the store.", "usage": {"input_tokens": 103, "output_tokens": 112, "total_tokens": 215}, "response_time": 3.212351485771915}
