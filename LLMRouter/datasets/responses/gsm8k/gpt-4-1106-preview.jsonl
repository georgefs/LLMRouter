{"key": "gsm8k_175", "text": "First, we need to calculate the total revenue Juan and Carlos made from selling lemonade. Since they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, the revenue per gallon is:\n\n$0.50 * 20 = $10\n\nNow, we know they made $25 in profit. To find out the total revenue, we add the profit to the total cost:\n\nTotal revenue = Profit + Total cost\n\nSince we don't know the total cost yet, we'll use the total revenue to find out how many gallons they sold:\n\nTotal revenue / Revenue per gallon = Number of gallons sold\n\nLet's assume the total revenue is X. Then:\n\nX / $10 = Number of gallons sold\n\nNow, we know that for each gallon, the cost is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, which is a total cost of $5 per gallon. The profit is made by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:\n\nProfit = Total revenue - (Number of gallons sold * Cost per gallon)\n\nWe know the profit is $25, so we can set up the equation:\n\n$25 = X - (Number of gallons sold * $5)\n\nSince we don't know the total revenue (X) yet, we can't solve for the number of gallons sold directly. However, we can express the number of gallons sold in terms of the total revenue:\n\nNumber of gallons sold = X / $10\n\nNow we can substitute this back into the profit equation:\n\n$25 = X - ((X / $10) * $5)\n\nTo solve for X, we multiply both sides of the equation by $10 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n$250 = 10X - (X * $5)\n\n$250 = 10X - 5X\n\n$250 = 5X\n\nNow we divide both sides by 5 to solve for X:\n\nX = $250 / 5\n\nX = $50\n\nThis means the total revenue is $50. Now we can find out how much they spent on lemons. Since the total cost per gallon is $5 and $3 of that is for lemons, we can find the number of gallons sold:\n\nNumber of gallons sold = Total revenue / Revenue per gallon\n\nNumber of gallons sold = $50 / $10\n\nNumber of gallons sold = 5 gallons\n\nNow we can calculate the total amount spent on lemons:\n\nAmount spent on lemons = Number of gallons sold * Cost of lemons per gallon\n\nAmount spent on lemons = 5 gallons * $3/gallon\n\nAmount spent on lemons = $15\n\nJuan and Carlos spent $15 on lemons.", "usage": {"input_tokens": 59, "output_tokens": 117, "total_tokens": 176}, "response_time": 3.7575067201246886}
